Weather conditions refer to the state of the atmosphere at a specific location and time. They encompass various factors that describe the current atmospheric state, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, cloud cover, and more.  
Steps :
1.Set Up Your Project:
Create a new directory for your project and set up your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. You can name them index.html, styles.css, and script.js, respectively.
2.Design the User Interface (HTML and CSS):
Build the layout of your weather app using HTML for structure and CSS for styling.
3.Fetch Weather Data (JavaScript):
In your script.js file, you'll use JavaScript to fetch weather data from a weather API and update the UI with the retrieved information. 
{Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key and 'CityName' with the desired city name.}
4. Testing and Finalization:
Open the index.html file in a web browser to see your weather app in action. Make sure you have a valid API key and an internet connection to fetch weather data.
